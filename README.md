# Notes

This is a simple repo to store personal notes about stuff I have touched and might need to remember. I like to save these notes as markdown files due to

- simplicity
- readability
- convertibility (e.g. via [pandoc](pandoc.md))
- greppability

Note that they are by way *not* written by an expert, so use with care!
