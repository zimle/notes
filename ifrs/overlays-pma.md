# Overlays and Post-Model-Adjustments (PMA)

IFRS9 allows for adjusting the provision of an accepted model when new risks emerge.
This allows the bank to react on unforeseen constellation that cannot be easily reflected in an old model.

## Definition

Here is some definition according to a [blog post of the ECB](https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/blog/2023/html/ssm.blog230526~29af0452d6.en.html) (but not a generally accepted):

- An `overlay`, also called `post-model adjustment` is the type of adjustment that is performed only after the model is operated.

- An `in-model adjustment` is an adjustments that is performed inside of the IFRS 9 model - either before or during the run time of the model. For instance, adjustments to the model input (e.g. overrides to the component of forward-looking information), adjustments to the model parameters (e.g. alteration of a PD model input parameter), or ad hoc adjustments to the model or model calibration
